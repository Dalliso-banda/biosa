## Text-to-Speech Introduction in TensorFlow.js

This project demonstrates a text-to-speech (TTS) system implemented in TensorFlow.js (tfjs). The TTS model is designed to generate speech audio from input text, allowing users to listen to content directly in their browsers without requiring server-side inference.

### About the Model

The included TTS model has been trained using lecture audio from biology courses. Please be aware that the training data was sourced from recorded lectures without explicit permission from the speakers; as such, this model is for research and educational purposes only. Redistribution or commercial use of models trained on non-consensual data may have legal and ethical implications.

### Features

- **In-browser Text-to-Speech:** Enter text and listen to generated audio instantly.
- **TensorFlow.js Implementation:** No server needed; everything runs client-side in JavaScript.
- **Custom Model:** Trained on real biology lecture data for domain-specific pronunciation and vocabulary.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dalliso-banda/biosa.git
   cd biosa
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Or open `index.html` in your web browser.

4. **Try it out:**
   - Type or paste biology-related text into the input box.
   - Click "Speak" to hear synthetic audio generated by the model.

### Ethical Notice

The TTS model was trained using data from recorded biology lectures without explicit consent from the original speakers. This repository is intended for educational and research exploration of TTS technologies only. Please do not use this model or any derived works for commercial purposes or redistribution without proper consideration of data rights and privacy.
